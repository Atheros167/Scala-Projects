## List of Projects on Scala

#### **Data Visualization Project**
1. This project was to showcase some of the cool visualizations that are possible with Scala
2. This imports data obtained from [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/hiteshp/make-in-india/data) 
   to do some dashboarding and visualization exercises.The dataset details the Imports and Exports from India for three years (2014-2016) to various countries.From this we can build a few simple plots and summarizations
3. There are a lot of possible graphs, I have tried a few of them
4. The URL to work interactively on this is available here:[Link]('https://my.datascientistworkbench.com/tools/zeppelin-notebook/')

#### ** String_Compare **

1. Check if any alphabet in one word exists in another word
2. Scope of the project
    Identify how many of the words are common in the two words
    Which characters are common?

   [Link]('https://www.kaggle.com/c/acquire-valued-shoppers-challenge/data')
    
    The dataset includes the Offer Table with details related to the Offers for coupons. The large transaction table holds 1 years worth of transaction history. There are two separate datasets - Training Dataset and Test Dataset.

    The purpose of this project is to use the available data to build a Logistic Regression model that uses the training data to create a model that can be used to score the test dataset. The output is to predict the likelihood of a customer using the coupon.
