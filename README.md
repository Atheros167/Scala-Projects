## List of Projects on Scala

#### **Data Visualization Project**
    - This project was to showcase some of the cool visualizations that are possible with Scala

    - This imports data obtained from [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/hiteshp/make-in-india/data) to do some dashboarding and visualization exercises.The dataset details the Imports and Exports from India for three years (2014-2016) to various countries.From this we can build a few simple plots and summarizations

    - There are a lot of possible graphs, I have tried a few of them

    - The URL to work interactively on this is available Here [Link](https://my.datascientistworkbench.com/tools/zeppelin-notebook/)

#### ** String_Compare **

    - Check if any alphabet in one word exists in another word
    
    - Scope of the project

        * Identify how many of the words are common in the two words
        * Which characters are common?
        * Index of the common characters.
        * Toggle the cases of the common characters in both words

#### ** Kaggle Value Shopper **

    *This is a Kaggle Competition located at: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/acquire-valued-shoppers-challenge/data)

    *The dataset includes the Offer Table with details related to the Offers for coupons. The large transaction table holds 1 years worth of transaction history. There are two separate datasets - Training Dataset and Test Dataset.

    *The purpose of this project is to use the available data to build a Logistic Regression model that uses the training data to create a model that can be used to score the test dataset. The output is to predict the likelihood of a customer using the coupon.
