## List of Projects on Scala

#### **Data Visualization Project**
1. This project was to showcase some of the cool visualizations that are possible with Scala
2. This imports data obtained from [DVP](https://www.kaggle.com/hiteshp/make-in-india/data) 
   to do some dashboarding and visualization exercises.The dataset details the Imports and Exports from India for three years (2014-2016) to various countries.From this we can build a few simple plots and summarizations
3. There are a lot of possible graphs, I have tried Pie Chart and Bar Graph
4. The URL to work interactively on this is available here

#### **String_Compare**

1. Check if any alphabet in one word exists in another word
2. Scope of the project
    Identify how many of the words are common in the two words
    Which characters are common?
    Index of the common characters.
    Toggle the cases of the common characters in both words

#### **Fibonacci Sequence**
1. Learning to work with integers and
2. Creating Objects with Main and
3. Creating Objects without Main

#### **Kaggle Value Shopper - Logistic Regression**

1. This is a Kaggle Competition located at: 
[Val_shop](https://www.kaggle.com/c/acquire-valued-shoppers-challenge/data)
    
    The dataset includes the Offer Table with details related to the Offers for coupons. The large transaction table holds 1 years worth of transaction history. There are two separate datasets - Training Dataset and Test Dataset.

    The purpose of this project is to use the available data to build a Logistic Regression model that uses the training data to create a model that can be used to score the test dataset. The output is to predict the likelihood of a customer using the coupon.


    
#### **Ecommerce Customer - Linear Regression**

1. We have a dataset containing customer information for a ecommerce company
2. Our Objective here is to use the available data:
    Transform the data into Labels and Features for ML library to use
    Apply Linear Regression on the data to predict the yearly spend by a customer.
    Print out the metrics of the Regression models
3. The data set is included as Ecommerce_customer.csv
4. The dataset is available in the [Data](https://github.com/Atheros167/Scala-Projects/blob/master/Ecommerce%20Customers.csv)
5. The code is available at the [Code_lin_reg](https://github.com/Atheros167/Scala-Projects/blob/master/Ecommerce_Customers.scala)


#### Unsupervised Clustering - K Means Clustering

1. The objective is to use the data available to correctly predict the region from the following 7 input variables:
   1)	FRESH: annual spending (m.u.) on fresh products (Continuous);
   2)	MILK: annual spending (m.u.) on milk products (Continuous);
   3)	GROCERY: annual spending (m.u.)on grocery products (Continuous);
   4)	FROZEN: annual spending (m.u.)on frozen products (Continuous)
   5)	DETERGENTS_PAPER: annual spending (m.u.) on detergents and paper products (Continuous)
   6)	DELICATESSEN: annual spending (m.u.)on and delicatessen products (Continuous);
   7)	CHANNEL: customers Channel - Horeca (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) or Retail channel (Nominal)
2. The data is available at [Clus_data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers)
3. The code is available at [Clus_code](https://github.com/Atheros167/Scala-Projects/blob/master/Kmeans_wholesale_customers.scala)
